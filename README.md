# AI4ME Transcript Processor

A containerized FastAPI service that converts transcripts into shortform content. An external orchestrator sends a `job_id`, this service reads the transcript from a shared volume, runs it through a local Ollama LLM, and returns a catchy title + summary — also writing the result back to the shared volume.

## How it works

```
Orchestrator
    │  1. Writes  shared/{job_id}/transcript.txt
    │  2. POST /process  {"job_id": "...", "job_type": "script"}
    │  3. Reads   shared/{job_id}/output.json

    ├── FastAPI :8000
    └── Ollama  :11434 (localhost only, models bind-mounted from host)
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Edit docker-compose.yml and set OLLAMA_MODEL to the model you want to use

# 2. Build and start
#    First run: the container will automatically pull OLLAMA_MODEL into ./weights/ollama
#    if it isn't already there (requires internet access, may take a few minutes).
docker compose up --build

# 3. Poll until ready
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 4. Create a test job and send it
mkdir -p ./shared/test123
echo "FIFA is a sports governing body that organizes association football events all over the world. FIFA outlines several objectives in its organisational statutes, including growing the game internationally, ensuring it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[7] It is responsible for organising and promoting association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which began in 1930, and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[8] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US$5.8 billion, ending the 2019–2022 cycle with a net positive of $1.2 billion, and cash reserves of over $3.9 billion." > ./shared/test123/transcript.txt

## API

### `POST /process`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `job_id` | string | yes | Orchestrator-assigned job identity |
| `job_type` | string | yes | Must be `"script"` |
| `language` | string | no | Response language, e.g. `"en"`, `"zh"` (default `"en"`) |
| `callback_url` | string | no | If set, result is POSTed here after `output.json` is written |
| `prompts` | string | no | Overrides the requirements section of the prompt (see Prompt structure below); must contain a `{language}` slot |

**Response (HTTP 200):**
```json
{
  "job_id": "test123",
  "title": "Why Morning Routines Are Secretly Rewriting Your Brain",
  "summary": "Researchers found that habits formed before 9 AM have an outsized impact on daily productivity, driven by peak prefrontal cortex plasticity immediately after waking.",
  "model": "llama3.2:3b",
  "processing_time_ms": 4217
}
```

The same payload is written to `shared/{job_id}/output.json`.

**Error responses:**

| Status | Condition |
|---|---|
| 404 | `transcript.txt` not found for the given `job_id` |
| 413 | Transcript exceeds `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS` limit |
| 422 | `job_type` is not `"script"`, or transcript is empty |
| 503 | Ollama is not ready |

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "ollama_ready": true, "model": "llama3.2:3b" }
```

Returns HTTP 503 if Ollama is not ready. Poll this before sending the first job.

## Composing with the orchestrator

Build the image once from this repo, then reference it by name in the orchestrator's `docker-compose.yml` — no source code needed on the orchestrator side.

**Step 1 — Build the image:**
```bash
docker compose build
```

**Step 2 — Add this snippet to the orchestrator's `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
  transcript-processor:
    image: ai4me-transcript:latest
    container_name: transcript-processor
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./weights/ollama:/root/.ollama/models
      - ./shared:/shared
    environment:
      - OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
      - SHARED_VOLUME_PATH=/shared
      - UVICORN_WORKERS=1
      - UVICORN_LOG_LEVEL=info
      - MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS=0
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If distributing across machines, push to a registry first:
```bash
docker tag ai4me-transcript:latest your-registry/ai4me-transcript:latest
docker push your-registry/ai4me-transcript:latest
```
Then update `image:` in the snippet above to match the registry path.

## Prompt structure

The prompt sent to Ollama is assembled from two separate files:

| File | Editable | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `app/prompts/transcript.txt` | Yes — overridable via `prompts` field | Requirements: what the model should produce and in what style |
| `app/prompts/output_structure.txt` | No — always fixed | Output schema: the exact JSON format the model must return |

The final prompt assembled at runtime looks like:

```
<system>
{requirements}          ← from transcript.txt, or the prompts field if provided
{output_structure}      ← always from output_structure.txt, never overridden
</system>

<user>
Transcript:
---
{transcript text}       ← injected by the service, not part of either template
---
Produce the JSON output now.
</user>
```

Keeping the output structure fixed means the JSON parser always gets a predictable response regardless of what custom requirements are passed in. When providing a custom `prompts` value, only include a `{language}` slot — the transcript and output format are handled automatically.

## Configuration

All values are hardcoded in `docker-compose.yml` — no `.env` file needed. The only line you'll typically change is `OLLAMA_MODEL`.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `llama3.2:3b` | Model tag; pulled automatically on first run if missing |
| `SHARED_VOLUME_PATH` | `/shared` | Container-side path — matches `./shared` mount |
| `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS` | `0` | Character limit per request; `0` = no limit |

## Notes

- **CPU-only**: no GPU assumed. Inference on a 3B model takes 15–90 s. Set your orchestrator's HTTP timeout above 120 s.
- **Serial processing**: one request at a time. Scale by running multiple container replicas behind a load balancer.
- **Models are not bundled in the image**: stored in `./weights/ollama`, pulled automatically on first run.
